\
Controls:\
a, d -> yaw\
s, w -> pitch\
q, e -> roll\
\
-, = -> decrease or increase sim speed ( +- 10000 )\
\
Thrust can be simulated using the slider. Thrust can only be applied when sim speed is 1.\
\
TODO:\
Allow for spacecraft to enter orbit around other bodies.\
Add new spacecraft with clearer options.
